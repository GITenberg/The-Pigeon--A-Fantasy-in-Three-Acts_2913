description: This 1912 drama, subtitled A Fantasy, is a sharp satire on the hypocrisies
  of those who set themselves up to help the less fortunate but who are really pursuing
  selfish agendas. Here Christopher Wellwyn, an artist of limited means, generously
  shares all that he has with anyone in need of it, alienating his practical daughter,
  Ann.
